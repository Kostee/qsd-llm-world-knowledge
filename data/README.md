# Data

This repository separates code from data.

- `data/raw/` – full datasets (not tracked by git).
- `data/sample/` – small samples used for quick tests (tracked).

Expected files (local only):
- `MM_balanced_dataset.csv`
- `dataset_for_llms.csv`
- `folds_indices.csv` (if needed for PLM reproduction)
